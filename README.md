======================

A public repository of my academic articles that have been published, most
latex sources here are post-print author versions with my custom latex styles.
I provide HTML versions on github pages and bibliography in bibtex file,
possibly converted to other formats. I do not publish PDF versions here
since PDF is a rubbish format only usable for printing and you shouldn't 
really be printing stuff in 2020s. You can compile your own PDFs if you
really must, or search for the official publications.

The name of the repo refers to *broken telephone* / *indian whisper* gag in
Simpsons episode *PTA Disbands* (S6E21), which you should find very relevant to
my research.

The directory names follow the hierarchy of year-event-topic, where topic is
optional. The makefiles create the paper in format Author-year-event..., this
is to identify that it is author's post-publication draft version. 

The data and code for most articles is usually available in some other
repositories.

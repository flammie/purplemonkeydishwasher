# Flammieâ€™s bibliographies

This directory contains my bibliographies. I write them by hand in bibtex and
convert them to endnote with bibutils and to HTML with [my own XSLT script
mods2html.xsl](mods2html.xsl).

* [pirinen.bib](pirinen.bib) is all academic works authored by me in original
  bibtex source file
* [pirinen.enw](pirinen.enw) is endnote version (automatically converted, I do
  use endnote and cannot guarantee it works
* [pirinen.html](pirinen.html) is a generated html page that shows all those
  documents, it's not as nice as [this front page](../index.html) but I made
  it as an engineering exercise and it was fun

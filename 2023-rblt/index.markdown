# Rule-Based Language Technology

This is a book that was released 2023, free open access. The book was made in
Microsoft word so my HTML versions are generated via pdftotext and minor
automatic fixups, so there are several quality issues, however, as an archival
copy this works just fine for my purposes. Please see [the publisher's
repository page](https://dspace.ut.ee/handle/10062/89595) to find the original
version instead.

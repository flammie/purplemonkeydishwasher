<p class="ltx_p">This study discusses the way different numerals and related expressions are
currently annotated in the Universal Dependencies project, with a specific
focus on the Uralic language family and only occasional references to the
other language groups. We analyse different annotation conventions between
individual treebanks, and aim to highlight some areas where further
development work and systematization could prove beneficial. At the same
time, the Universal Dependencies project already offers a wide range of
conventions to mark nuanced variation in numerals and counting expressions,
and the harmonization of conventions between different languages could be
the next step to take. The discussion here makes specific reference to
Universal Dependencies version 2.8, and some differences found may already
have been harmonized in version 2.9. Regardless of whether this takes place
or not, we believe that the study still forms an important documentation of
this period in the project.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Numerous treebanks in the Uralic languages have become available within the
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Universal Dependencies</span> (UD) project <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">ud281</span>]</cite>. In recent
years, at least within the Uralic language family, we have seen new treebanks
emerging in languages with closely related siblings that already have an
existing treebank. Examples of such languages are Skolt Saami, in relation to
Northern Saami <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">tyers2017annotation</span>]</cite>, Komi-Permyak, in relation to
Komi-Zyrian <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">partanen2018first</span>]</cite>, or Moksha in relation to Erzya
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">rueter2018towards</span>]</cite>. Although the entirety of Uralic languages is still not
fully represented within the Universal Dependencies project, the situation has
improved in many ways since the last survey on the state of this language family
in UD was conducted <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">partanen-rueter-2019-survey</span>]</cite>. While more extensive
surveys are useful, we think there are situations where individual nuanced
features should be compared between the languages, so that consistency could be
maintained and improved upon. At the same time, this may provide a thoughtful
point of departure for new discussions around such features, as we believe the
questions discussed here are relevant beyond the realm of Uralic languages.
Even in other treatment of UD on different language groups, such as Slavic,
numerals have been recognized as one category that demands special attention
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">zeman2015slavic</span>]</cite>. Recently Schneider and Zeldes have also discussed
inconsistent nominal constructions in the English treebanks
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">schneider2021mischievous</span>]</cite>, and even the issues we describe in the
Uralic treebanks here can well be described in a similar vein. These are not
dramatic issues, but small points of divergence that we could pay attention to,
but if we decide to do so, we would also need to devise strategies to
operationalize the edits in numerous languages with a long history of treebank
work.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We can additionally point to recent discussions within the Universal
Dependencies project where the various ways to annotate English numerical
expressions have been
discussed.<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup>

Conversations such as these are relevant for Universal Dependencies developers
more widely, and for the sake of consistency such decisions should be at least
considered for the other languages in the project. Our study also discusses
some numeral types in the Uralic languages that are known, but not yet attested
in the treebanks. Thereby, their description provides an important starting
point for future work on these languages, during which these forms will
inevitably be encountered.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In this paper, we discuss numerals in the Uralic languages. Probably the
simplest approach would be to gather all numeral-type words on the basis of
their <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Universal part-of-speech numeral</span> (UPOS NUM) value or features
making reference to numerals in different Uralic languages. Among the features
at least <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">NumType</span> is one that would be presumed to be present with all
numerals, although it also occurs widely with other parts of
speech.<span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup>

          https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/NumType.html</span></span></span> The
possible, currently documented numeral types are cardinal numerals, ordinal
numerals, multiplicatives, fractions, distributives, sets or collective numerals
and ranges. These concepts provide a good base for a relatively elaborate and
nuanced system, but at this phase the UD system appears slightly asymmetric.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Potential asymmetry might be dealt with by adding a binary for the split between
numerals and counted nouns versus nouns with sequential deixis-like marking. In
the Erzya, Moksha languages, sequential deixis is readily attested in
combination with multiplicatives and sets, but due to the fact that ordinals
only comprise three combinatorial instances in Erzya, it may strike us as
fruitless to introduce a plus/minus binary for ordinal. The Erzya examples below
illustrate this.</p>

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Above, we can observe that the approximatives and distributives including
universal quantifiers are not associated with sequential deixis in Erzya.
Whereas, sequence and range might readily be combined. In counting iterations of
a predicate, Erzya shows a clear distinction between it and quantification of
mass (‘twice’ and ‘twofold’ cannot be equated), but this distinction becomes
less obvious when applied to a sequential deixis system. A glimpse at
Komi-Permyak and Komi-Zyrian will remind us that multiplicatives may also be
used in a distributive context <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">rueter2020questions</span>, 22]</cite>. Multiplicatives,
sets, distributives, etc. should not be distinguished from ordinals any more
than they are from cardinals, since the term cardinal might readily be treated
as a <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">zero</span> like nominative singular. The last three items within the
list above are also exceptional as they would demand syntactic dependency ‘det’,
which according to the guidelines is not allowed. Analogically, chosen
conventions could possibly also be extended to the annotations of items such as
English ‘both’ and Swedish ‘bägge’.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Conceivably, numerals might be divided into various categories according to
their semantic use. The most predominant numeral types might therefore be
associated with quantification, sequence, and entity naming. Quantification
articulates distinctions in the mechanisms of counting. Singular entity counting
is typified by the use of cardinals (such as in Finnish <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">yksi</span> ‘one’,
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">kaksi</span> ‘two’, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">kolme</span> ‘three’, etc.), and there may be different
marking patterns for the counted noun.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In many languages, there are standards by which the head noun of a
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">nummod</span> dependency takes special marking. In Komi-Zyrian, Komi-Permyak
and Hungarian, for example, the counted noun shows no deviance from its regular
nominative singular marking strategies when qualified by any cardinal numeral.
In Balto-Finnic, Finnish, Estonian, Livvi and Karelian, the partitive singular
marks the counted nouns when they are qualified by numerals two and above, even
though their syntactic position would otherwise call for a nominative
singular—for other cases a fitting semantic or syntactic case is used, i.e.
phrase agrees in case.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Contrastively, the Mordvin languages, Erzya and Moksha, exhibit a variation that
has yet to be researched in depth, i.e. counted nouns do not obligatorily take
special marking when qualified by cardinal numerals two and upward, see
Markov <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">markov1961prialatyrski</span>, 42]</cite> and

Saami languages attest to two different strategies: Northern Saami takes
genitive singular marking of its counted nouns when qualified by numerals two
and above, whereas Skolt Saami makes a three-way split, a genitive singular
marking the numeral range 2–6, and the partitive marking seven and upward (with
the decline in language proficiency the use of the partitive has become less
certain).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Sets of entities, i.e. sets with more than single members, are counted
synthetically across the languages with various strategies. In Finnish, for
example, pairs of scissors are counted by using plural forms of the cardinal
numerals and the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">np</span> head noun alike, e.g. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">yhdet sakset</span> ‘one
pair of scissors’ (here both the numeral and the noun it qualifies are in the
plural, and unlike Russian the distinction is retained for numerals five and
above, too). In contrast, Erzya has its own numeral forms typically derived in
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">-Onst</span>, hence <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">kavonst vasońpejeĺt’</span> ‘two pairs of scissors’ with
the counted noun in the plural. Although numerals of the sets type are
typically introduced for counting pairs, they are, in fact, often used with
larger sets, such as sets of six cups and saucers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Iterations of predications are often counted with adverb derivations of cardinal
numerals, but the productivity of these derivations still requires assessment
from language to language. While Finnish only minimally utilizes the word forms
in <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">-sti</span>: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">kahdesti</span> ‘twice’, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">kolmesti</span> ‘thrice’ and
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">tuhannesti</span> ‘a thousand times’, the Hungarian, Komi-Zyrian,
Komi-Permyak, Erzya and Moksha languages use regular derivations for indicating
‘X times’, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">-szer/-ször/-szor</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">-ïś</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">-iś</span>,
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">-kśt’</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">-kśt’</span>, respectively. Needless to say, matters become
confusing when these iterative numerals are categorized as multiplicatives in
UD. The result, at least in Erzya, is that ‘being paid <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">kavkśt’ = twice</span>’
and ‘being paid <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">kavońkirda = double</span> or <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">twofold</span>’ are registered
as the same thing, which is by no means always the state of affairs
semantically, but from a syntactic perspective it is plausible.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p12" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Distributive numerals are not a simple class. They can be further categorized
into subclasses, as immediately becomes apparent in the two Hungarian
strategies: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">két-két</span> ‘two each’ with a noun head, and
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">kettesével</span> ‘two at a time’ with a verb head. Whereas the former may be
used as a definite numeral in the context <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Berta és Rudi két-két csomagot
hozott</span> ‘Berta and Rudi brought two suitcases each’, implying that a total of
four suitcases were brought, the latter expression is indefinite. The indefinite
distributive numeral <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">kettesével</span> ‘two at a time’ in nearly the same
context <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Berta és Rudi kettesével hozta a csomagokat</span> ‘Berta and Rudi
brought the suitcases two at a time’<span id="footnote4" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">4</sup>

would indicate that each iteration of the predication involves two suitcases,
but there is no indication regarding the number of iterations – it could be any
number of times. In this context, definiteness is lent by the object, i.e. ‘the
suitcases’.</p>

from the words <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pari</span> ‘couple’ and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">kymmentä</span> ‘ten (partitive)’.
In addition to constructions with the element <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pari</span>, there are fairly
regular derivations formed from other basic numerals as well: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">kolmisen</span>
+ <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">kymmentä</span> ‘approximately thirty’.

<div id="S2.p14" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In Erzya, as in Moksha, approximative forms in <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">-ška</span> are found for
counting entities <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">vet’eška lomań</span> ‘about five people’ and iterations
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">kolmoškakst’</span> ‘about three times’. With the use of an approximative
numeral, the likelihood rises that no plural marking is indicated on the counted
noun. The predominance of nominative singular marking of the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">np</span> head
also holds when the approximative is marked with an N–(N + 1) strategy, i.e.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">vet’e-koto lomań</span> ‘five-or-six people’. The use of adjacent numerals to
indicate approximate values is also found in Komi-Zyrian, i.e.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">vit-kvajt</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">vit-ö-kvajt</span> both translate to five or six.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p15" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In Finnish, the expression of range with numerals follows the same pattern as is
observed in point of departure to end destination, i.e. the elative case marks
the starting point, and the illative marks the end point. In the range 5–7
kilometers, the Finnish involves <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">viidestä seitsemään kilometriä</span>
five+elative, seven+illative and kilometer+partitive, which is the same counted
noun strategy observed in basic numerals.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p16" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Fractions in Finnish can be expressed in at least two different ways. One way is
to join the ordinal nominative singular with the noun <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">osa</span> ‘part’, hence
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">viides</span> + <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">osa</span> = <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">viidesosa</span>, where only the end is
declined and as such is distinguished from ‘the fifth part’ of something, where
we would actually be talking of sequences. Syntactically, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">neljä
viidesosaa</span> ‘four fifths’ functions in the same manner as any noun with a
cardinal qualifier, i.e. the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">np</span> head is marked with the partitive
singular when in an otherwise nominative-singular position
nummod(<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">viidesosaa</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">neljä</span>). The second derivational expression
for ‘fifth’ is <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">viidennes</span>, it too is treated syntactically as a counted
noun, as appears to be the case in other Uralic languages.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p17" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Universal quantifiers, such as the Finnish <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">molemmat</span> ‘both’, have more
complex counterparts in Hungarian <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mindkettő</span> (literally ‘all’ + ‘two’),
which may also take associative marking for first, second and third persons
plural in <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mindkettünk</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mindkettetek</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mindkettük</span>,
respectively. The Hungarian <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mindhárom</span> ‘all three’, ‘tous les trois’
then comes as no surprise, and one begins to expect subsequent <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mindnégy</span>
‘all four’. Komi-Zyrian and Erzya attest to yet another aspect: the associative
personal reference can also be in the singular, allowing for access. If we are
speaking of a singular ‘person’ and mention that ‘the (lit.) three of him/her
are moving to town’ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">rueter2013quantification</span>]</cite>, we access a definite
universal quantifier pronoun with reference to this single person. This feature
is not observed in Hill Mari or Udmurt <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">kelmakov2008udmurtin</span>, 111–112]</cite>.
Ordinal numerals can be associated with multiplicative, iterative and sets
features. This has been observed in the presentation of some morphology for
Erzya, above.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Numerals appear in entity naming, for example the Finnish <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">viitonen</span>

the one hand, but it could also be used in reference to a street car, where we
would be more likely to translate it as ‘street car five’ or ‘street car number
five’. Thus is fits directly into a list of problems in apposition, such as ‘the
color purple’, ‘the word terrorist’ and many others including numerals discussed
by Schneider and Zeldes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">schneider2021mischievous</span>]</cite>. An extension to
this numeral issue is found in Finnish <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">viitonen</span> in reference to ‘house
number five’, but the same <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">5</span> is transformed to the cardinal-form
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">viisi</span> if the house is <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">5a</span> or <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">5b</span> – <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">viisi a</span> or
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">viisi b</span>, respectively (no partitive, of course, so we are not counting
letters). Here, the Erzya solution is to use the ordinal <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">vet’eće</span> ‘the
fifth’ for <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">5</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">vet’eće a</span> ‘fifth a’ for <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">5a</span>, which
results in ambiguous homonymy.</p>

<div id="S2.p19" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">There are differences observed across languages, where synthetic versus analytic
expressions of the same numerical values might be dealt with differently. Thus,
our first overview discusses the largest spread of numeral types, forms across
languages. Once the collection is complete, the numeral words can be classified
according to the dependencies and features. In Finnish, for example, we predict
four different and regular dependencies: nummod (for cardinals and plural
cardinals with plurale tantum), advmod (for counting iterations of a
predication, e.g. once, twice, thrice), advcl (for distributive quantification),
amod (for ordinals). Other languages, it will be noted, may have extensive det
(this is not really productive in Finnish, but would be the equivalent for
‘both’ and its analogues with universal quantification of numbers three and up,
probably with person marking as well, e.g. ‘the two of us’).</p>

Thereby, in the UD guidelines both <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ADV</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ADJ</span> are often found
as the part of speech categories for numeral expressions. At the same time,
there are also situations where the NumType feature occurs with different parts
of speech.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In several treebanks in the Romance languages, for example, there are pronouns
such as Spanish <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mucho</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">poco</span> which have a feature value
NumType=Card. Such marking on pronouns is not common in the treebanks, although
we do find English <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">first</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">second</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">third</span> and
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">latter</span> receiving POS tag <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">PRON</span> and feature NumType=Ord. This is
also the style in Finnish, with <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">toinen</span> ‘second; another’ being marked
similarly, and Erzya and Komi-Zyrian treebanks offer similar examples. As the
combination PRON and NumType can be found only in treebanks for 10 different
languages, we believe it is highly likely that similar annotations could be
extended to many other languages within the project.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Nouns that are marked with NumType appear in a bit larger array of languages,
all in all within 13 languages, among them, Uralic languages North Saami, Erzya
and Estonian. In North Saami, these instances are collective nouns with
NumType=Coll. In Erzya word <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pel’</span> ‘half’ is marked with NumType=Frac. In
Estonian the only occurrences are with gene names containing numbers, such as
IL-5, where NumType=Card is attested. These are all reasonable uses of NumType,
as these noun types do have countable properties that are relatively well
captured by the NumType feature. But again as the solutions seem language
specific the annotations could be somehow harmonized or extended to more
languages.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In Finnish, Icelandic and Korean treebanks we find examples of punctuation being
marked with NumType=Card. No matter how the annotation is motivated, being this
rare and narrowly distributed is possibly problematic for the comparability of
the languages. The Estonian treebanks EDT and EWT only use NumType with two
values, Card and Ord. This does not appear to rule out fractions, but they are
dealt with differently, i.e. 3/4 is given the features NumForm=Digit and
NumType=Card. Of course, here the value <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Digit</span> indicates not written as
words. A second issue in EWT is that the feature <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">NumType=Ord</span> is used
with both UPOS <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NUM</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ADJ</span>. It seems that ordinal digital
numerals consisting of an Arabic numeral followed by a full stop are treated as
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ADJ</span>, whereas automobiles from different years have an abbreviated year
digit pair followed by an apostrophe. This latter type has the UPOS value
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NUM</span>, should this be the case? We will not widely compare the
differences between multiple treebanks on the same language, although we do
acknowledge this is an issue that needs further attention.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The cardinal numeral type in UD is typified as an expression for counting
singular items. Thus, this feature might be associated with the UD part of
speech NUM (as in one, two, three, etc.). This feature value is also used with
non-numerals (as in <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">many</span>, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">few</span>, Czech <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">kolik</span> ’how
many’, etc.). Here, however, individual languages make a split between use of
UPOS <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DET</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NUM</span>. The latter of which, apparently, is defended
in Czech by a strong grammatical tradition, might be used for the interrogative
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">kolik</span> ’how many’, which evokes cardinal numerals. Czech includes yet a
third type of words as cardinals which seem to indicate the total number, e.g.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">čtvero</span> (as in <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Čtvero ročních dob</span> ‘The Four Season’, all four),
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">desatero</span> (as in ‘the Ten Commandments’, all ten). This presumably
explains the definition of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">oba</span> ‘both’, which in Czech is marked as UPOS
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">NUM</span>, whereas Talbanken deals with <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">bägge</span> ‘both’ as a
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">DET</span>. And then there is the one instance of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">desatero</span> in the
treebank <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Desatero investora</span> ‘Lit. The ten investors’, where the word

there is also an advmod dependency, associated with ordinal multiplicatives,
such as the Czech <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">poprvé</span> ‘for the first time’. By applying the feature
value NumType=Ord to both UPOS <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ADJ</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ADV</span>, we could remove
the NumType=OrdMult feature value used in Komi-Zyrian <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ńol’öd</span> ‘fourth’
UPOS <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ADJ</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ńol’ödyś</span> ‘for the fourth time’ UPOS <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ADV</span>
and similarly in Erzya, Moksha and Komi-Permyak. The downside is that the
parallel between cardinal and ordinal multiplicatives becomes less obvious. If
we were to do so, we would be faced with the challenge of addressing numerals
with three features: ordinal multiplicative and distributive.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">As we have shown, numerals and related expressions are an area for fruitful and
needed further discussion in the Universal Dependencies project. Which forms all
get numeric features extends widely beyond just numerals themselves, and many
lexical items that have counting properties could be annotated with NumType
features, and already be annotated in different treebanks. Which of the
individual solutions in different treebanks should be described better in the
documentation and adapted further, and which should be harmonized in comparable
uses of the treebanks, remains to be discussed, but we hope our observations
help at least a bit along this path. Of course, how work on various
inconsistencies should or could be coordinated across the hundreds of treebanks
already in the Universal Dependencies project is not entirely clear, and remains
certainly a large challenge. At the same time, new treebanks are still
continuously emerging, and paying attention to various strategies used in
existing treebanks should help the maintainers of these new languages to adapt
their conventions. When diverse language families are included, new questions
inevitably arise. For example, in Apurinã there are very few actual cardinal
numbers and quantification is expressed in verbal constructions
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">facundes2021numexpr</span>, <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">rueter2021apurina</span>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The issue how to handle Komi-Zyrian numerals was also recently discussed in the
relation to Komi morphological analyser <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">rueter2021komifst</span>, 67]</cite>, which
points to the fact that the best possible annotation scheme is often a very
relevant question for uses beyond the Universal Dependencies project itself. We
also believe that the classification and annotation of numerals is important
from the point of view of basic linguistic research and language description. As
the description of Erzya counting expressions in this study showed, the system
is already very complicated and nuanced in this one language, and is just
starting to be adequately described in the newest grammatical descriptions
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">suihkonen2013typology</span>]</cite>. We presume the description of many smaller Uralic
languages remains much less complete, not to even mention less studied language
families of the world, which also have started to have significant presence in
the Universal Dependencies project. This kind of easily accessible information
about counting expression at large could be immediately beneficial, for example,
in typological research, and systematic annotations and documentation in
projects such as Universal Dependencies is one modern way to distribute this
description.
